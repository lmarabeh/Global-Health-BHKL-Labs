                <h3>Visualization Design Rationale</h3>
                <p>We selected a scatter plot as our primary visualization 
                because it effectively captures the multidimensional relationship 
                between economic prosperity (GDP per capita) and 
                health outcomes (life expectancy), while allowing additional 
                variables to be encoded through color and size. Circle color 
                represents the Aggregate Score, providing an integrated perspective 
                of overall development, and circle size denotes population, emphasizing 
                countries with broader demographic influence. The logarithmic 
                x-axis was chosen after initially testing the raw GDP per capita 
                values. Using the original scale resulted in an extremely uneven 
                distribution, with high-income countries concentrated on the far 
                right and most low and middle-income nations compressed near 
                the origin. By applying a logarithmic transformation, we achieved 
                a more balanced visual distribution that allows meaningful 
                comparisons across all economic levels. In terms of interaction 
                design, we incorporated a series of dynamic query techniques to 
                promote intuitive exploration. The year slider enables users to examine 
                temporal changes and development progress, while the region filter 
                facilitates comparisons among continents. Tooltips reveal country-specific 
                details on demand, maintaining a clean and uncluttered interface. 
                The addition of zoom functions further enhances usability, particularly 
                when navigating densely populated regions of the plot. Together, these 
                design choices create a cohesive and engaging visualization that invites 
                users to investigate how economic and health indicators evolve and 
                interact over time.</p>
