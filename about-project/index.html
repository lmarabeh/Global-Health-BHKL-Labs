                <h3>Visualization Design Rationale</h3>
                <p>We selected a scatter plot as our primary visualization 
                because it effectively captures the multidimensional relationship 
                between economic prosperity (GDP per capita) and 
                health outcomes (life expectancy), while allowing additional 
                variables to be encoded through color and size. Circle color 
                represents the Aggregate Score, providing an integrated perspective 
                of overall development, and circle size denotes population, emphasizing 
                countries with broader demographic influence. The logarithmic 
                x-axis was chosen after initially testing the raw GDP per capita 
                values. Using the original scale resulted in an extremely uneven 
                distribution, with high-income countries concentrated on the far 
                right and most low and middle-income nations compressed near 
                the origin. By applying a logarithmic transformation, we achieved 
                a more balanced visual distribution that allows meaningful 
                comparisons across all economic levels. In terms of interaction 
                design, we incorporated a series of dynamic query techniques to 
                promote intuitive exploration. The year slider enables users to examine 
                temporal changes and development progress, while the region filter 
                facilitates comparisons among continents. Tooltips reveal country-specific 
                details on demand, maintaining a clean and uncluttered interface. 
                The addition of zoom functions further enhances usability, particularly 
                when navigating densely populated regions of the plot. Together, these 
                design choices create a cohesive and engaging visualization that invites 
                users to investigate how economic and health indicators evolve and 
                interact over time.</p>
                
                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>At the checkpoint stage, our team explored multiple datasets and visualization 
                concepts to identify a topic that would offer both analytical depth and visual 
                clarity. After evaluating several possibilities, we agreed that global development 
                and health indicators provided a meaningful and data-rich foundation for exploration. 
                Each member created early prototypes to test feasibility, which led to the shared 
                decision to build an interactive visualization highlighting the relationship between 
                economic and health dimensions across countries. During the implementation phase, 
                tasks were divided based on individual strengths and workflow priorities. Layth was 
                responsible for data transformation and cleaning, calculating the Aggregate Score, and 
                establishing the initial JavaScript framework, later refining the zoom interaction to 
                improve usability. Khanh converted the static Python prototype into a D3 implementation, 
                incorporating bubble visualization and responsive layout adjustments. Hangyi designed and 
                implemented the year slider and legend, developed hover and highlighting interactions, and 
                managed GitHub synchronization. Bee created the control panel layout, refined the year and 
                region filters, and enhanced the zoom and interface design to ensure visual consistency and 
                smooth user interaction. All members contributed to the final write-up, ensuring that the 
                rationale and methodology were cohesive and accurately represented the collaborative process. 
                Communication and version control were maintained through Discord and GitHub, allowing the 
                team to iteratively test, review, and refine the visualization. Overall, the project was 
                completed within approximately two weeks, requiring around 45–50 person-hours in total. 
                Each member dedicated roughly 10–20 hours. Through consistent collaboration and iterative 
                refinement, our team transformed a basic static chart into a comprehensive and exploratory 
                visualization of global development patterns.</p>
